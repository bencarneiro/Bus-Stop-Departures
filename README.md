# Bus-Stop-Departures

This Application displays the upcoming bus departure times for the bus stop by my house. It is designed to be displayed in my living room.

The App reads the GTFS (General Transit Feed Speficification) and Real Time Bus Positions from the City data portal. It crunches the numbers and tells me when the next bus is coming for my stop

It's a work in progress
